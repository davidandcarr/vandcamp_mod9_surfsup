## Surf and Scoop Business Analysis

This week the client is a prospective small business owner in Hawaii. Upon hearing the business strategy I can't help but be sold - surfing and ice cream in Hawaii. I've been tasked with analyzing some weather data to make sure this beach stand is a slam dunk or.. macking.

### June Temps - Peak Summer
Everybody knows the best nugs are caught with the sun high and the water warm. Using 7 years of data racking up 1700 temperature reads we're looking at some prime ice cream and surf weather.

As you can see, we've got an enjoyable heat. Over seven years and it never got over 85 degrees. This, combined with peak tourism dates in June means plenty of  Bennys trying to hang ten, then needing a treat to ice out their ego when they fall out. Surfers aside, most everyone will enjoy a sweet, cool treat when they're in paradise.

### December Temps - Peak Winter
Much like its distant redneck cousin, Destin, Florida, Hawaii touts a rush of winter tourism as folks are itching to shed their winter coats. And it's no wonder with temps like these in Oahu.

Slightly less data points (maybe the lifeguards had holiday benefits) but the December numbers are just as favorable as June. With some conjecture, about 70% of the temperature reads in December are 70 degrees or higher. While the waters may be a little cooler from the migratory currents, the beach will certainly still be an ideal sightseeing and ice cream eating spot on the island.

## Closer - Logistics
Clearly there is an argument to be made that the everlasting summer is the ideal spot for an ice cream and surf shack. Truly the only barriers I can foresee here is either local codes about beach trash, or possibly exorbidant costs for shipping and refridgeration. Perhaps bake in some of those costs to a gimmick like popsicle sticks that are made of old surf boards. This adds a dash of sustainability, branding, and may justify charging double for simple frozen juices. Grab your grease and carve those sands my dude.
